  # Mock BlackJack
  
</div>

This application aims to simulate BlackJack. Users are able to play by themselves or with multiple other players.\
#### The aim of the game:
The object of the game is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21. \
If a hand goes over 21, it is called a “bust” or “break” and the wager is lost. In 21, \
Jacks, Queens, Kings and 10s count as 10.

The application takes from a deck that is shuffled, so it is limited to a maximum of 4 players.
