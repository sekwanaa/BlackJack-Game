### Rules
The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it.\
Here are some key rules:

* **Card Values**: Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11.
* **Gameplay**:
  * Each player is dealt two cards, face up. The dealer is dealt two cards, with one face up and one face down.
  * Players must decide to hit, stand, double, or split.
  * The dealer reveals the hidden card and must hit until their cards total 17 or higher.
* **Winning**:
  * If your hand is closer to 21 than the dealerâ€™s hand, you win.
  * If your hand exceeds 21, you bust and lose the bet.
  * If the dealer busts, you win.
  * If you and the dealer have the same total, it's a push (tie).
